# A Research Agenda for Safe AGI: Benchmarks, Metrics, and Experimental Priorities


## Abstract
Rapid advances in machine learning and large-scale models make artificial general intelligence (AGI) a realistic research target within the coming decades. This paper reframes the safety and governance challenges identified in the accompanying report into an actionable, research-oriented agenda intended to engage academic researchers and industrial model developers (e.g., Google Research, Anthropic/XAI, Amazon, DeepMind). We synthesize high-priority technical problems, propose concrete experimental directions, define evaluation metrics and benchmarks, and offer organizational and policy recommendations to accelerate safe deployments while preserving innovation. The goal is to convert high-level concern into reproducible research tasks, shared benchmarks, and coordinated industry practice. 


## 1. Introduction & Motivation
The accompanying report provides a concise overview of risks and solution concepts for AI/AGI safety. Building on that foundation, this paper translates conceptual challenges into a prioritized research program that is (1) technically specific, (2) measurable, and (3) directly relevant to industrial model development pipelines. We aim to give researchers and engineering teams a clear set of experiments, metrics, and collaborative mechanisms that companies can adopt or sponsor to materially improve robustness, interpretability, and alignment. 


## 2. Framing the Problem: Risks that Require Research Attention

We categorize safety challenges into four interdependent vectors:

1. **Specification and misalignment risks.** Models optimizing proxy objectives can exploit specification gaps (reward hacking, unintended behaviors).  
2. **Robustness and distributional generalization.** Performance in lab conditions diverges from real-world contexts; small shifts can produce catastrophic failures.  
3. **Capabilities-driven systemic risks.** As models gain broader capabilities (planning, tool use, autonomous decision-making), they can create emergent risks that are not reducible to component failures.  
4. **Governance and socio-technical risks.** Competitive pressures, opaque supply chains, and lack of standardized audit practices impede coordinated mitigation.

Each vector admits concrete experimental hypotheses and metrics below. The original report outlines these risks at a conceptual level; our contribution is to make them experimentally tractable and operational for industry R&D. 


## 3. Technical Research Pillars & Concrete Experiments

### 3.1 Specification-Robust Objective Design
**Goal:** Reduce reward-gaming and specification failures.

**Experiments:**
- *Multi-objective reward modeling:* Train models with ensembles of human preference models and adversarial preference models; measure failures under adversarial prompts.
- *Counterfactual preference probes:* Construct tasks where human preferences vary by unobserved context; evaluate policy divergence.

**Metrics:** specification gap index (rate of high-utility-but-undesired outputs per 1k queries), human dissatisfaction delta.

### 3.2 Scalable Oversight & Interpretability
**Goal:** Make model reasoning transparent and verifiable at scale.

**Experiments:**
- *Iterated amplification vs. debate:* Implement both paradigms on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and compare correctness, detectability of deception, and compute cost.
- *Attribution and concept discovery:* Apply causal mediation and neuron-level attribution to identify concept representations; test interventions to suppress undesired concepts.

**Metrics:** explanation faithfulness, overseer bandwidth (human hours per 1000 evaluations), detectability of deceptive reasoning.

### 3.3 Robustness to Distribution Shifts and Adaptive Adversaries
**Goal:** Ensure safety under realistic distribution drift and adversarial inputs.

**Experiments:**
- *Open-world stress tests:* Create benchmarks with incremental distributional shifts (data source, prompt style, cultural context) and measure degradation curves.
- *Adaptive red-team competitions:* Continuous red-team challenges where attackers receive only aggregate feedback; measure time-to-exploit.

**Metrics:** robustness half-life (amount of drift until failure rate doubles), attack success rate under constrained attacker budgets.

### 3.4 Capability Containment & Safe Tooling
**Goal:** Securely integrate external tool use (code execution, web access).

**Experiments:**
- *Sandboxed tool interfaces:* Compare various interface designs (token-level restrictions, policy mediators) for safety and utility.
- *Credentialed proxy patterns:* Evaluate designs where the model proposes actions but must obtain human sign-off for high-impact tool use.

**Metrics:** rate of unsafe tool invocations, developer productivity delta.


## 4. Benchmarks, Datasets, and Shared Infrastructure

To move from ad-hoc evaluation to reproducible progress, we recommend industry and academia co-develop:

- **Alignment Stress Benchmarks (ASB):** suites of tasks that probe specification hacking, deceptive behaviour, long-horizon planning, and reward-misinterpretation.
- **Red Team Dataset Registry:** anonymized, curated attacks and exploit traces contributed by industrial red teams under NDAs to build robust defenses.
- **Audit Playbooks:** standardized protocols for model incident triage, forensics, and root-cause attribution.

These should be open where possible or governed via shared consortia to preserve competitive IP while improving communal safety.


## 5. Evaluation Metrics (operational & scientific)

We propose a compact set of operational metrics to accompany research outputs:

- **Safety Failure Rate (SFR):** proportion of outputs that violate a given policy/test.
- **Specification Gap Index (SGI):** normalized measure of divergence between objective proxy and human preferences.
- **Robustness Decay Coefficient (RDC):** slope of performance drop under incremental distributional shift.
- **Detectability Score (DS):** probability that an automated monitor or human overseer flags a deceptive/unsafe output.

Each metric must be paired with open evaluation code and seed datasets to enable cross-team comparability.


## 6. Organizational and Governance Recommendations

Companies should combine technical work with organizational changes:

1. **Internal Red-Team Independence:** Separate red-team teams from model dev and evaluation teams to reduce conflicts of interest.  
2. **Pre-Deployment Safety Gates:** Multi-factor checks before release (automated tests + human review + external audit for high-impact systems).  
3. **Third-Party Audits & Certification Pilots:** Jointly fund neutral audit bodies to develop certification standards for high-capability models.  
4. **Shared Incident Reporting:** Create a privacy-preserving incident registry to learn from near-misses and failures.

These items translate technical findings into practical guardrails that industry R&D leaders can implement.


## 7. Targeted Collaboration Models for Industry & Academia

To attract attention and participation from major R&D organizations, we recommend three collaboration vehicles:

- **Aligned Challenge Grants:** Industry funds for academic labs to reproduce model failure modes at scale and propose mitigations.  
- **Shared Red-Team Competitions:** Cross-company contests with shared scoring and aggregated anonymized results.  
- **Consortium-Hosted Benchmarks:** Neutral hosting of Alignment Stress Benchmarks with participation incentives (leaderboards, DOI datasets).

Such mechanisms reduce duplicated effort and enable rapid, accountable improvement.


## 9. Conclusion
The technical and societal stakes of advanced AI are high. Converting conceptual safety concerns into rigorous, measurable research is essential to align progress with human values. The accompanying report provides important framing; the next step is operationalizing research tasks, benchmarks, and collaborative mechanisms as laid out above.
